# Bomber Program

## Software Used:
Python 3.6

### Summary:
You are the pilot of a B-21 Raider stealth bomber moving invisibly over the Pacific ocean.  In this program you must expend your ammunition and destroy all targets while keeping the plane's health intact. When prompted, say "Yes" to fire missiles or "No" to abort mission and return to base. With each attack run you take a risk of being hit with an enemy missile, and you can only survive one direct hit.  Happy hunting.
